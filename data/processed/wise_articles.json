You'll see these statuses in the tracker:\n\nYour money's being processed: This means we're still waiting to receive the money from your bank.\n\nMoney received: This means we've got your money and we're converting it to the new currency.\n\nTransfer Sent: We\u2019ve now sent the money to your recipient\u2019s bank.

Check your currency for how long it can take.\n\nYour money is on its way, but the tracker might not update again until it has been delivered to your recipient's account.\n\nWhy is my transfer taking longer than expected?\n\nHere are the most common reasons for a delay.\n\nIt's taking a long time for your money to reach us\n\nIf your transfer has been on Your money's being processed for more than 2 working days, you should check with your bank to make sure they've sent the money to us.\n\nWe may need to verify your information\n\nSometimes we need extra information to meet regulations.

    "question": "When will my money arrive?",
    "answer": "\n\nWhen you make a transfer, we\u2019ll give you an estimate for when your money should arrive. But, there are a few situations where you might have questions about timing. Here are some tips to help you understand when it\u2019ll arrive, or why it\u2019s delayed.\n\nWise says that my transfer\u2019s due to arrive today.\u00a0\n\nGreat! Really that means your money should\u2019ve arrived already. We say that it\u2019s due today because some banks need a few hours to process transfers from us.\u00a0\n\nMy recipient\u2019s details may be\u00a0wrong.\u00a0\n\nSmall things like typos in names \u2014 for instance, spelling John Smith as Jon Smith \u2014 shouldn\u2019t be a problem for most countries. Your money should still arrive on time.\u00a0However, for some currencies, such as JPY, a typo like this can be an issue.\n\nIf something like an account number is\u00a0wrong, your money could take longer to arrive, or get returned to us. If your money does get returned to us, we\u2019ll let you know straight away.\u00a0\n\nTransfers on weekends and holidays.\n\nNot all countries have banking systems that work on weekends or holidays. Our delivery times factor in banking hours of the country you\u2019re sending money to.\n\nBut in some parts of the world, banks stop processing transfers early on Fridays.\n\nThat means, if your money\u2019s due to arrive on Friday, it may not show in your recipient\u2019s account until the next working day. We\u2019re working to find out which banks do this, and make our delivery estimates more accurate in the process.\n\nMy recipient says the money hasn\u2019t arrived yet.\n\nWe hope to never put you in this position. If your recipient says they haven\u2019t received your money yet, please ask them to check the following:\n\nThe sender name they\u2019re looking for.\u00a0Your recipient can try looking for a transaction on their bank statement from Wise \u2014 they might not see your name. The transfer might also come from one of our partners, but the amount and reference should still help find the payout.\n\nThe recipient\u2019s bank details.\u00a0If they\u2019re not right, your money could take longer to arrive, or get returned to us.\u00a0\n\nThe currency the recipient\u2019s account is in.\u00a0Your recipient\u2019s account may be in a currency that\u2019s different to the one you\u2019ve sent them. If that\u2019s the case, they could get a different amount from us because their bank might have converted the money.\n\nGetting a receipt.\n\nYour recipient\u2019s bank may be having problems processing your transfer. They\u2019ll have the money in their system, but won\u2019t have put it into your recipient\u2019s account.\u00a0\n\nOur receipt includes all our bank details and, for some currencies, tracking numbers too. That means when your recipient gives it to their bank, the bank should have all the info they need to track down your transfer.\u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s how to get your receipt:\n\nLog into your Wise account\n\nClick on your transfer\u00a0\n\nClick on the 3 dots on your browser to see a Get PDF receipt button, or click the button directly in the app\n\nSave it to your device and send it to your recipient\n\nInterest or Stocks\n\nIf you sent money using Wise Interest or Stocks there are thresholds for how much you can send each day without an added delay.\n\nFor more information, check the relevant page below based on the asset type that you want to transfer:\n\nTransferring from Interest currencies or Jars\n\nTransferring money held as Stocks\n\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo\nRelated articles\nWhat are Swift correspondent fees when sending and receiving money?\nWhy does it say my transfer's complete when the money hasn't arrived yet?\nI entered my recipient's email incorrectly\nHow will I get my refund?\nHow long will my transfer take?",

    "question": "Why does it say my transfer's complete when the money hasn't arrived yet?",
    "answer": "\n\nWe mark your transfer Complete when we\u2019ve sent the money to the recipient bank. And we leave a little room in our arrival estimate for the bank to process and release it.\n\nIf your recipient says they haven\u2019t yet received the money, there are two possible reasons why.\n\n1. The receiving bank is still processing the money\n\nBut some banks are slower than others \u2014 they might take up to 1 working day for them to release the money. So your money\u2019s safely on its way, but the recipient bank is still processing it. Your recipient can ask their bank to speed this up. They\u2019ll need a transfer receipt that has all the details.\n\nLearn how to download a transfer receipt\n\n2. The money has arrived, but it looks a bit different\n\nYour recipient might not recognise the transfer when it arrives in their account. Using the transfer receipt, we recommend they check:\n\nThe sender name and reference. Your recipient should look for a transaction on their bank statement from Wise \u2014 they won\u2019t see your name. The transfer might also come from one of our banking partners. In this case, they can identify it from the reference number.\n\nThe currency and amount. Your recipient\u2019s account might be in a different currency than the one you\u2019ve sent them. In this case, their bank will convert the money again, and the amount might be different than expected.\n\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo\nRelated articles\nWhen will my money arrive?\nWhat are Swift correspondent fees when sending and receiving money?\nI'm expecting money, but it hasn't arrived yet\nWhy is my transfer taking longer than the estimate?\nWhy does it say you're waiting for my money?",

    "question": "Why is my transfer taking longer than the estimate?",
    "answer": "\n\nWe give you an estimated delivery time when you set up your transfer. While most transfers arrive on time, delays can sometimes happen at any of the transfer stages:\n\nYour money is on its way to Wise: We\u2019re waiting for your money to arrive. This depends on how fast your bank sends the money to us.\n\nWe're processing your transfer: We have your money and are converting it. This is usually where security checks happen.\n\nYour money is on its way to the recipient: Now it\u2019s up to the recipient\u2019s bank to process it. If your transfer is taking longer than expected, your recipient can ask their bank to check on the payment. Share a transfer confirmation to help them.\n\nHere are the most common reasons for delays and what you can do.\n\nSecurity checks\n\nWe sometimes run extra checks to keep your money safe. This is a standard procedure for regulated financial institutions.\n\nIf we need more information from you (like ID or proof of where the money came from), we\u2019ll send you an email. We can't speed up these checks, but we work as fast as we can.\n\nLearn more about security checks\n\nThe payment method used\n\nSome payment methods are slower than others.\n\nPayment method\tSpeed to reach us\nCard payments\tUsually instant\nBank transfers\t1-4 working days\nSwift transfers\t1-6 working days\n\nWe always show you an estimate for each payment method when you set up your transfer.\n\nWeekends and public holidays\n\nBanks don't process transfers on weekends or public holidays. Our estimates only count working days (Monday to Friday).\n\nIf you send money on a Friday or before a holiday, it might not move until the next working day. This applies to banks in both the country you're sending from and the one you're sending to.\n\nMistakes in the recipient's details\n\nIf there\u2019s a typo in the recipient's name or account number, their bank might reject the payment and send it back to us.\n\nWe suggest you check your activity list. If the transfer status says the money is coming back to us, you can either fix the details or cancel the transfer.\n\nGood to know: Refunds can take a few days to process depending on the currency and payment method.\n\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo\nRelated articles\nWhy was my transfer cancelled?\nWhy is my account restricted?\nHow do I cancel my transfer?\nHow do I get my money back if the transfer is complete?\nWhy is Wise asking me to pay again?",

    "question": "What is a proof of payment?",
    "answer": "\n\nA proof of payment is a document showing you\u2019ve sent money from your bank account. This could be a PDF of your bank statement, or a screenshot\u00a0from your online bank.\n\nWe might ask for a proof of payment, and it's usually for one of two reasons:\n\nThe money you sent hasn\u2019t reached us in the expected time frame.\n\nWe received your money, but need to verify it came from an account in your name.\n\nIf we need proof of payment, we\u2019ll send you an email explaining how to upload it.\n\nWhat does my proof of payment need to show?\n\nTo accept your proof of payment, the document must clearly show:\n\nYour details \u2014 your full name and account number\n\nYour bank\u2019s name\n\nOur details \u2014 our name (Wise Ltd) and our account number\n\nDate \u2014 when the payment was initiated\n\nAmount \u2014 the amount you sent to us\n\nCurrency \u2014 the currency you sent the money in\n\nReference \u2014 the reference you added to your payment\n\nGood to know\n\nIf you can't fit all these details in one screenshot, you can send us two. Both screenshots must show your bank account number so we can confirm the information is for the same account.\n\nWe can\u2019t accept text that has been copied and pasted into an email, or a photo of your computer screen. Please make sure to upload a high-quality screenshot or a PDF of your bank statement.\n\nFor Swift payments, the proof of payment we need is an pacs.008 document.\n\nFor payments from Australia or New Zealand, a screenshot of your online banking isn\u2019t enough. We\u2019ll also need to see a recent bank statement that shows your name, the date of issue, and your bank details. You can also send us just the bank statement, as long as it shows all the details listed above.\n\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo\nRelated articles\nRetrieving your Proof of Payment from Japanese Bank Account\nWhat is Verification of Payee?\nI may be the victim of a scam involving a Wise account\nWhat is Confirmation of Payee (Australia)?\nWhat is Confirmation of Payee (UK)?",

    "question": "What's a banking partner reference number?",
    "answer": "\n\nFor every transfer you send with Wise, we give you a transfer number, which you can use if you need to get in touch with us.\n\nFor some transfers, we\u2019ll also give you a banking partner reference number. It\u2019s called this because we send out your money through local banking partners in each country.\n\nHow do I use the banking partner reference number?\n\nGive the banking partner reference number to your recipient. They can use the banking partner reference number to see where the transfer is once it\u2019s shown as completed on your Wise account.\n\nThe recipient will need to give this number to the recipient\u2019s bank if they get in touch with them.\n\nIn different countries, banks might call it something else. For example, in India, banks sometimes call it a UTR (Unique Transaction Reference) number, or a transaction reference number.\n\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo\nRelated articles\nWhat's a guaranteed rate?\nWhere can I find my membership number?\nWhat's a UTR number, and where can I find it?\nHow our account details use partner banks\nWhat's the Wise API?",
